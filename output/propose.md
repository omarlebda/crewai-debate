The situation in Palestine can be classified as genocide due to the deliberate and systematic targeting of a specific ethnic group with the intent to destroy it, whether in whole or in part. The term "genocide," as defined by the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, encompasses acts committed with the intention to kill, inflict serious bodily or mental harm, and intentionally impose living conditions calculated to bring about physical destruction.

In Palestine, numerous reports and documented evidence indicate actions that align with these definitions, such as blockades that prevent access to essential resources, military operations that result in disproportionate civilian casualties, and policies that systematically erode the means of survival for the Palestinian people. These actions are not merely incidental consequences of conflict; they represent an intent to undermine the existence of a people who resist domination.

Critics of the use of the term "genocide" may argue that the situation should be labeled a war, but it is essential to recognize the power dynamics at play. A war entails conflict between parties that have a semblance of equal agency. In contrast, the Palestinian people face existential threats, disproportionate military force, and severe restrictions imposed by a more powerful state actor. The ongoing narrative around the situation in Palestine must reflect this reality, as the systematic oppression and the impact on the civilian population showcase more than just wartime casualties; they depict a calculated effort to eradicate a people.

By framing the issue as genocide, we emphasize the urgency of international response and accountability. Recognizing it as such compels the global community to take action to prevent further atrocities and uphold the rights and dignity of the Palestinian people. Thus, the reality unfolding in Palestine transcends the parameters of mere warfareâ€”it embodies a grave humanitarian crisis that demands immediate and serious consideration as genocide.
